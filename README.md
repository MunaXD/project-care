## Inspiration

See a child begging on the streets? Would you give them 20 Rs. or would you rather give them a future?
After traveling and returning back to Pakistan, we realized that children begging on the streets is _not_
normal. Only in Pakistan are these future doctors, engineers, and entreprenuers ignored.

We wanted to help eliminate this terrible practice, but imagine our surprise when we discovered that
the law already exists to curb it. This SDG Hackathon gave us the ability to use our technology for good.

As a citizen of this country, and as a human-being you must ask yourself: **Why are there children still begging on the streets?**

### There are Laws

> 36/36A "If a person employs a child for begging or causes a child to beg"...or "employs or incites a child to sell goods with the intention of begging"..."he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years"..."with fine which may extend to one hundred thousand rupees"

> 24 "A child protection officer may take into custody a destitute and neglected child and produce him along with the complaint before a court within twenty four hours of taking the child into such custody"

> “‘protection’ means shelter, maintenance, education, healthcare and well-being of a destitute and neglected child…”

— [_The Punjab Destitute And Neglected Children Act 2004_](http://punjablaws.gov.pk/laws/472.html)

### There is an Organization

> In order to provide care, rehabilitation, education and
training to the destitute and neglected children, Government of the Punjab established Child Protection and Welfare Bureau in March, 2004.

> Not only this but a child protection court has also been
established which addresses the issues like custody and legal reunification of the children with their parents.

>A child helpline has also been set up which provides guidance, help and coordination for their rescue and protective custody.

### This is a social problem, and YOU can fix it

With the Project C.A.R.E App, you can navigated through a set of instructions that you can check off and take steps to have the child reported and further take actions against the child's handler.
